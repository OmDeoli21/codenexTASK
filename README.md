# codenexTASK

1. First, the program says hello and asks you to type in marks for 5 subjects.  
2. It uses a for loop to go through subjects one by one.  
    Inside that, there’s a while loop that keeps asking until you give a valid number (0–100).  
    So if you type something wrong , it will ask again.  
3. All the marks you enter are saved in a list called marks.  
4. After you’re done, the program adds them all up sum and finds the average.  
5. For the grading part :  
    90 or more → Grade A  
    75 or more → Grade B  
    50 or more → Grade C  
    Less than 50 → Grade F  
6. It prints out your total marks, average, and grade.
